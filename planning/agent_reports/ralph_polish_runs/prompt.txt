You are an autonomous coding agent working on the Noema repository.

MISSION (priority order):
1) Add a real gnark circuit test for the PolicyGateCircuit (using our in-repo Poseidon implementation, package circuits).
2) Make the circuit test pass reliably (compile -> prove -> verify) using Groth16 on BN254.
3) ONLY AFTER tests pass: wire the backend plumbing to call the gnark prover/verifier behind the existing zk.GenerateProof / zk.VerifyProof API, keeping the public API shape unchanged (proof_b64 + public_inputs_b64).

HARD RULES:
- DO NOT run git commit, git reset, git clean, or anything that modifies git history.
- Keep changes small: max 3 files per iteration. If more is needed, stage work across multiple iterations.
- No cosmetic-only edits.
- No new dependencies unless absolutely necessary. Use existing gnark dependencies already in the repo. If gnark is not yet in go.mod, add it only if unavoidable.
- Do not change routes or response shapes. Keep /api/evaluate and /api/verify behavior stable.
- Do not redesign UI. This task is ZK/circuit/testing/plumbing only.
- Always run: cd backend && go test ./... at least once per iteration.

WORKFLOW YOU MUST FOLLOW (do not skip):
A) Inspect current circuit code and poseidon implementation:
   - Find the PolicyGateCircuit (the policy ZK circuit) and confirm it imports and uses circuits.Poseidon (NOT gnark/std poseidon).
   - Confirm fixed N=6 and the frozen constraint ordering.
B) Add tests FIRST:
   - Create a new Go test file for the circuit (example name: backend/internal/zk/policy_circuit_test.go or wherever circuits live).
   - The test must:
     1) Compile the circuit to R1CS
     2) Run Groth16 setup
     3) Build a witness with a PASS case and generate a proof
     4) Verify the proof using the public witness
     5) Build a witness with a FAIL case and confirm either:
        - proving fails (unsatisfied), OR
        - proving succeeds only if OverallPass is set correctly (0), AND verifying matches the expected output
   - Use deterministic test vectors:
     - datasetDigestLo/Hi fixed constants
     - enabled/maxAllowed/severity arrays fixed constants
     - Compute the expected Commitment in-circuit by setting Commitment to the same value computed by the circuit.
       (In gnark tests, you can set Commitment as a public variable equal to circuits.Poseidon(domainSep + inputs) by reusing the same circuits.Poseidon function in a small helper circuit OR by computing it with the same function in-circuit and asserting equality.)
   - The test must assert:
     - OverallPass == 1 for pass vector, and verify passes.
     - OverallPass == 0 for fail vector, and verify passes only with correct OverallPass.
C) Fix whatever is broken until all tests pass:
   - If compilation errors, fix imports or package paths.
   - If poseidon params/functions missing, use the existing in-repo Poseidon code as the single source of truth.
   - If constraints are wrong, fix circuit logic minimally.
D) ONLY AFTER TESTS PASS: wire plumbing:
   - Replace stub proof internals inside backend/internal/zk/zk.go (or equivalent) to use gnark Groth16 BN254:
     - GenerateProof: build witness from inputs (enabled/maxAllowed/severity + datasetDigest limbs) and output proof bytes base64
     - VerifyProof: decode proof and public inputs and verify using vk
   - Keep existing API signatures and keep proof_b64 + public_inputs_b64 shape.
   - You may keep public_inputs_b64 as the existing string format for now, but the verify path must map it deterministically to the circuit’s public witness (Commitment, OverallPass, MaxSeverity).
   - Ensure keys are handled sanely for dev:
     - For now, allow generating proving/verifying keys at startup or cached on disk under backend/internal/zk (dev only),
       OR embed small test keys only for tests.
     - Don’t over-engineer; prioritize working tests and stable verify.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (must satisfy):
- `cd backend && go test ./...` passes.
- There is at least one new test that proves+verifies the circuit in a PASS case.
- There is at least one test that demonstrates FAIL behavior (overall_pass=0) is enforced and verifiable.
- If plumbing was wired, verify endpoint still accepts proof_b64/public_inputs_b64 and returns verified result correctly.

OUTPUT FORMAT (end of each run):
- Files changed (list)
- What you changed (2–6 bullets)
- Tests run (must include go test ./...)
