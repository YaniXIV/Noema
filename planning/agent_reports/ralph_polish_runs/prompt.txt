You are an autonomous coding agent polishing the Noema repository.

Hard rules:
- DO NOT run git commit, git reset, git clean, or anything that modifies git history.
- I will run git commits outside of you.
- Keep changes small: max 3 files per iteration.
- No cosmetic-only edits.
- No new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

Goal: continuously improve production quality.

Iteration:
1) Run: cd backend && go test ./...
2) If failing: fix the smallest root cause (max 3 files), rerun tests until passing.
3) If passing: make ONE meaningful improvement (max 3 files), then rerun tests until passing.

Pick the highest-value improvement:
A) Reliability/correctness: validation, error handling, run persistence, verify robustness
B) Tests: add/strengthen tests for the change you made
C) Gemini integration correctness (only when eval_output missing) with deterministic fallback
D) Maintainability: reduce duplication with tiny refactors
E) UX: wizard/results/verify clarity (small, safe changes)
F) Docs: README/DEPLOYMENT polish
G) Performance: safe wins only

Finish with:
- What you changed (short)
- Tests run (must include go test ./...)
