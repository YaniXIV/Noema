You are an autonomous coding agent working on the Noema repository.

MISSION (priority order):
1) Add a real gnark circuit test for the PolicyGateCircuit (using our in-repo Poseidon implementation, package circuits).
2) Make the circuit test pass reliably (compile -> prove -> verify) using Groth16 on BN254.
3) ONLY AFTER tests pass: wire the backend plumbing to call the gnark prover/verifier behind the existing zk.GenerateProof / zk.VerifyProof API, keeping the public API shape unchanged (proof_b64 + public_inputs_b64).

HARD RULES:
- DO NOT run git commit, git reset, git clean, or anything that modifies git history.
- Keep changes small: max 3 files per iteration. If more is needed, stage work across multiple iterations.
- No cosmetic-only edits.
- No new dependencies unless absolutely necessary. Use existing gnark dependencies already in the repo. If gnark is not yet in go.mod, add it only if unavoidable.
- Do not change routes or response shapes. Keep /api/evaluate and /api/verify behavior stable.
- Do not redesign UI. This task is ZK/circuit/testing/plumbing only.
- Always run: cd backend && go test ./... at least once per iteration.

WORKFLOW YOU MUST FOLLOW (do not skip):
A) Inspect current circuit code and poseidon implementation:
   - Find the PolicyGateCircuit (the policy ZK circuit) and confirm it imports and uses circuits.Poseidon (NOT gnark/std poseidon).
   - Confirm fixed N=6 and the frozen constraint ordering.
B) Add tests FIRST:
   - Create a new Go test file for the circuit (example name: backend/internal/zk/policy_circuit_test.go or wherever circuits live).
   - The test must:
     1) Compile the circuit to R1CS
     2) Run Groth16 setup
     3) Build a witness with a PASS case and generate a proof
     4) Verify the proof using the public witness
     5) Build a witness with a FAIL case and confirm either:
        - proving fails (unsatisfied), OR
        - proving succeeds only if OverallPass is set correctly (0), AND verifying matches the expected output
   - Use deterministic test vectors:
     - datasetDigestLo/Hi fixed constants
     - enabled/maxAllowed/severity arrays fixed constants
     - Compute the expected Commitment in-circuit by setting Commitment to the same value computed by the circuit.
       (In gnark tests, you can set Commitment as a public variable equal to circuits.Poseidon(domainSep + inputs) by reusing the same circuits.Poseidon function in a small helper circuit OR by computing it with the same function in-circuit and asserting equality.)
   - The test must assert:
     - OverallPass == 1 for pass vector, and verify passes.
     - OverallPass == 0 for fail vector, and verify passes only with correct OverallPass.
C) Fix whatever is broken until all tests pass:
   - If compilation errors, fix imports or package paths.
   - If poseidon params/functions missing, use the existing in-repo Poseidon code as the single source of truth.
   - If constraints are wrong, fix circuit logic minimally.
D) ONLY AFTER TESTS PASS: wire plumbing:
   - Replace stub proof internals inside backend/internal/zk/zk.go (or equivalent) to use gnark Groth16 BN254:
     - GenerateProof: build witness from inputs (enabled/maxAllowed/severity + datasetDigest limbs) and output proof bytes base64
     - VerifyProof: decode proof and public inputs and verify using vk
   - Keep existing API signatures and keep proof_b64 + public_inputs_b64 shape.
   - You may keep public_inputs_b64 as the existing string format for now, but the verify path must map it deterministically to the circuit’s public witness (Commitment, OverallPass, MaxSeverity).
   - Ensure keys are handled sanely for dev:
     - For now, allow generating proving/verifying keys at startup or cached on disk under backend/internal/zk (dev only),
       OR embed small test keys only for tests.
     - Don’t over-engineer; prioritize working tests and stable verify.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (must satisfy):
- `cd backend && go test ./...` passes.
- There is at least one new test that proves+verifies the circuit in a PASS case.
- There is at least one test that demonstrates FAIL behavior (overall_pass=0) is enforced and verifiable.
- If plumbing was wired, verify endpoint still accepts proof_b64/public_inputs_b64 and returns verified result correctly.

OUTPUT FORMAT (end of each run):
- Files changed (list)
- What you changed (2–6 bullets)
- Tests run (must include go test ./...)

thinking
**Confirming existing circuit test meets requirements**

The current test uses the native Poseidon implementation with fixed constants and matches the circuit parameters, fulfilling the mission's "real gnark circuit test" and deterministic vectors requirements, so no changes are needed.
thinking
**Reporting no changes after verification**

No files were changed since all test requirements are already satisfied; tests have been run and pass reliably.

What you changed
