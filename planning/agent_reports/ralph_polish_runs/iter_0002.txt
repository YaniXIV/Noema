You are an autonomous coding agent polishing the Noema repository.

Hard rules:
- DO NOT run git commit, git reset, git clean, or anything that modifies git history.
- I will run git commits outside of you.
- Keep changes small: max 3 files per iteration.
- No cosmetic-only edits.
- No new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- keep all the same ui functionality, the end user should be able to do the same stuff but the experiance and design should be better.

Goal: continuously improve production quality. continuously improve front end quality and polish.

Iteration:
1) Run: cd backend && go test ./...
2) If failing: fix the smallest root cause (max 3 files), rerun tests until passing.
3) If passing: make ONE meaningful improvement (max 3 files), then rerun tests until passing.

Pick the highest-value improvement:
A) Reliability/correctness: validation, error handling, run persistence, verify robustness
B) Tests: add/strengthen tests for the change you made
C) upgrading the user interface so that it looks better.
D) Maintainability: reduce duplication with tiny refactors
E) UX: wizard/results/verify clarity (small, safe changes)
F) Docs: README/DEPLOYMENT polish
G) Performance: safe wins only

Finish with:
- What you changed (short)
- Tests run (must include go test ./...)
mcp startup: no servers

**Listing frontend files**

I'm listing frontend files, focusing on the web directory to identify up to three files for meaningful polish improvements.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /Users/yani/Noema/backend && ls' in /Users/yani/Noema/backend succeeded in 52ms:
cmd
data
go.mod
go.sum
internal
web

thinking
**Identifying frontend platform**

The frontend appears to be a web-based application using a list component or structure.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /Users/yani/Noema/backend/web && ls' in /Users/yani/Noema/backend succeeded in 52ms:
static
templates

thinking
**Checking templates**
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /Users/yani/Noema/backend/web/templates && ls' in /Users/yani/Noema/backend succeeded in 51ms:
app.html
app_new.html
app_results.html
index.html
partial_header_app.html
partial_header_public.html
partial_header_upload.html
partial_orb.html
upload.html
verify.html
verify_results.html

thinking
**Considering CSS placement**

I'm evaluating moving CSS files into the static directory to improve organization or loading behavior.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /Users/yani/Noema/backend/web/static && ls' in /Users/yani/Noema/backend succeeded in 51ms:
app.js
constraints.js
results.js
styles.css
upload.js
verify.js
wizard.js
