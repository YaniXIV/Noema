# Agent: DOCS

Goal: Rewrite README for hackathon quality, include architecture diagram and submission checklist.

Read first:
- planning.md
- README.md

Testing requirement:
- No tests required unless you touch code. If you do, run `go test ./...`.
- If you can’t run tests, document why.

File ownership (allowed to edit):
- `README.md`

Do not edit:
- `backend/*`
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `planning/*` (except this report file)

Tasks (do in order):
1) README refresh
- Make it concise and hackathon‑ready.
- Include architecture diagram (ASCII or Mermaid).
- Add quickstart, env vars, and endpoints.
- Emphasize Gemini 3 integration and ZK proof pipeline.

2) Submission checklist
- Add section with: Gemini 3 integration write‑up, demo link, code repo, 3‑min video.

Deliverables
- Updated README.md
- Any new docs files if helpful.

Questions to resolve (ask PLANNER if blocked):
- Whether to include licensing/credits.
